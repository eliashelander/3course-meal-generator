# 3 Course Meal Generator
> Command line script to generate a full 3 meal courses including a starter, main and dessert.

The script will randomly select 3 dishes and return a full 3 course meal of a starter, main and dessert. It does so by randomly selecting a starter from a list of starters, then repeating the same pricess with mains and desserts.

The final return of the script will look like this 'Here is our 3 course meal. For starter we have {Starter}, for main we have {Main} and {Dessert} for dessert.'

## Usage example

Run ```node course_generator.js``` in your terminal. This will return a random 3 course meal in your command line.

## Development setup

The only requirment is that you have a terminal to run with node. So make sure to install node if it's not already installed on your computer.

Check if you have node:
```node
```

If you don't see a version of node beeing returned, install node. If you have brew you can run:
```brew install node
```
Otherwise you can first [install brew](https://medium.com/@hayasnc/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew-b33780287d8f).
